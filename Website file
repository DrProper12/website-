UI

The UI of the website must be appealing and well designed. Each page of the website can have its own sub categories and more. 
The point of the website is to give users a homely feeling as well as being organized. Colour palettes of the websites can change according to seasons and time of day 
and the algorithm suggests recipes and foods related to that particular season or time of day.
